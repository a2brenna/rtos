Wire Protocol: Pending
    Capnproto based wire protocol for accessing remote Object Store that exposes
a superset of reference implementation (FS_Store).  Allows drop in replacement
of local Object Store with a remote Object Store.

Performance Tracking: Pending
    Log timing/metadata information for all requests to underlying storage and
for all incoming requests.

Object Metadata: Pending
    Allow clients to retrieve Object size/ctime/mtime/atime etc. Either use
underlying storage (posix fs) or track this independantly.

Multi-Op Support: Pending
    Support for executing multiple standard operations at a time.  Wire protocol
should send them all at once and receive return codes/exception information for
them all at once.

Transaction Support: Pending
    Multi-Ops that succeed or fail atomically.

Server Side Copy: Pending
    Command for creating a copy of an Object addressed by a new key.  Exploit
underlying storage's ability to do COW (btrfs etc.) to make this operation as
fast as possible, but fallback to creating full copies.

Evolve/Mutate: Pending
    Exploit Server Side Copy implementation to allow a client to atomically copy
an Object and then perform a mutation before returning.
